        req.user = await User.findOne({ _id }).select("_id")         // creating a custom request method and setting it to the _id property after verifying. The .user we attached to it can be called it anything actually cus we are creating our own method. the reason for this will ultimately be to assign a single user to a particular workout when it is created to that we can filter by the user id when rendering. So in essence, before the user have access to the routes, a user must have been identified already

//the last process and the _id destructuring in the try block is for for the workout controller when we try to find a user workouts by id
